# Design Patterns

📁 **Creational Pattern**
   - 📁 Factory Pattern
     - Defines an interface for creating objects, but allows subclasses to decide which class to instantiate.
   - 📁 Abstract Factory Pattern
     - Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
   - 📁 Builder Pattern
     - Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create various representations.
   - 📁 Singleton Pattern
     - Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
   - 📁 Prototype
     - Specifies the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance, and creates new objects by copying this prototype.

📁 **Structural**
   - 📁 Adapter Pattern
     - Converts the interface of a class into another interface that clients expect. Allows classes with incompatible interfaces to work together.
   - 📁 Facade Pattern
     - Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem of classes, acting as a higher-level interface.
   - 📁 Proxy Pattern
     - Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.
   - 📁 Composite Pattern
     - Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Allows clients to treat individual objects and compositions uniformly.
   - 📁 Decorator Pattern
     - Dynamically adds behaviors to objects by wrapping them with one or more decorator objects.
   - 📁 Flyweight Pattern
     - Shares objects to support a large number of fine-grained objects efficiently.

📁 **Behavioural**
   - 📁 Mediator Pattern
     - Defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact, promoting loose coupling.
   - 📁 Observer Pattern
     - Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects, so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
   - 📁 Memento Pattern
     - Captures and externalizes an object's internal state without violating encapsulation, allowing the object to be restored later.
   - 📁 State Pattern
     - Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes, effectively changing its class.
   - 📁 Iterator Pattern
     - Provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.

📁 **Architectural**
   - 📁 MVC Pattern
     - Separates an application into three main components: Model (data and business logic), View (presentation layer), and Controller (handles user input and updates the model).
